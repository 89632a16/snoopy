RELEASE NOTE: v0.92
March 9, 2000

A bug was fixed with redirection on MS web servers. Also,
cookies are now passed through redirects.

This release also adds the ability to traverse html framed pages.
Just set $maxframes to the recursion depth you want to allow,
and results are returned in $this->results as an array.
See the README for an example.

RELEASE NOTE: v0.91
February 22, 2000

In previous versions of Snoopy, $this->header was an array containing key/value pairs of headers returned from fetched content, not including HTTP and GET headers. If a key value was the same, the old value was overwritten (Two Set-Cookie: headers for example). This was overcome by making $this->header a simple array containing every header returned. Therefore, it will now be up to the programmer to split these headers into key/value pairs if so desired.
